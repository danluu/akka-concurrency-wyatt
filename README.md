Worked though the examples in the pre-print of Derek Wyatt's book, Akka Concurrency. It's a well written book, but, a number of bugs were found in the text while working through the book, and I sometimes had to pick an arbitrary implementation for things where code was unexpectedly not provided or wouldn't compile, so the code here probably won't match the code in the final book.

This repo has pretty much all of the code in the book as of the second draft. It's possible the final version added more functionality, but I got the impression that the differences are mainly bug fixes.
